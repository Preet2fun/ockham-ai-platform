### Updated in this project
- Built "Hearth" — a sibling product to Synap: restaurant back-office console (foundations, login + 6-digit MFA, app shell, dashboard).
- Reused the repo's multi-tenant conventions: tenant resolved server-side, single tenant-scoped admin role, agent/viewer in schema but unused.
- Auth designed to the stated contract (/auth/login → /auth/mfa/send → /auth/mfa/verify); no SSO, no tenant field.
- Added `design_handoff_hearth/` — README, BUILD_PLAN, and a framework-agnostic reference prototype.
- Removed the earlier Synap/ITSM scaffolding (Customer App.dc.html) at the user's request.
