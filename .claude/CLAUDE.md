# CLAUDE.md — ITSM CloudNative Demo App

This file is loaded automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
Every rule here is non-negotiable. Read it fully before writing a single line of code.

This repo also contains three directory-scoped `CLAUDE.md` files that load
automatically alongside this one when you're working inside their trees:
`ai-engine/CLAUDE.md`, `platform-app/design_handoff_synap/CLAUDE.md`, and
`customer-app/design_handoff/CLAUDE.md`. Where any references "root
`CLAUDE.md` §N", that section number in **this** file must keep meaning the
same thing — §3 (Architecture Decisions) and §5 (OTel Instrumentation) are
load-bearing for `ai-engine/CLAUDE.md`'s cross-references. Don't renumber
them without updating that file too.

## 1. Vision & Architecture

This is a demo of an **AI-native observability/ITSM/security platform**,
proven out against a **real multi-tenant SaaS app** instead of synthetic data.
Three top-level projects, one purpose:

- **`customer-app/`** — a multi-tenant **restaurant/food-delivery SaaS app**
  (restaurants, menus, orders, delivery, payment). Deliberately polyglot
  (Go/Python/Java) and deliberately kept simple. Its only job is to generate
  real, tenant-scoped production-like activity — it is **the thing being
  observed**, not the interesting part of this repo.
- **`platform-app/`** — the platform. Started as a single-tenant ITSM demo;
  reframed as **the thing doing the observing**. Owns identity for both apps
  (its `user-service` is the *only* identity engine in the system). Its
  Incident module is becoming "incidents an AI agent investigated," not
  manually-filed tickets; its Asset service is becoming a topology-graph
  source.
- **`ai-engine/`** — the agentic AI layer, and the actual point of this repo.
  Consumes customer-app's tenant-tagged telemetry (flowing through
  platform-app's observability stack) to do agentic investigation — e.g. RCA
  — and writes what it learns back to memory for future retrieval. Governed
  by its own `ai-engine/CLAUDE.md`: 3 use-case tracks (SRE, ITSM, Security),
  LangGraph + Langfuse only, CI-gated online+offline evals.

**Never assume what's built.** This file states current architecture and
non-negotiable rules; it does not track task-by-task status — see §11. Design
history and rationale live in `docs/superpowers/specs/` (chronological,
later specs supersede earlier ones on overlapping topics) and
`docs/superpowers/plans/`. `INFRA-INVENTORY.md` (git-ignored, local) has the
actual measured cluster/DB numbers — trust it over any number written here if
they ever drift apart again.

---

## 2. MCP Servers — Use Them, Always

Six MCP servers are configured in `.claude/settings.json`. **You must use the right
server for every task instead of guessing or hallucinating values.** This ensures
every manifest, query, and config reflects the live state of the system.

| MCP Server | When to use it — mandatory scenarios |
|---|---|
| **filesystem** | Read any project file before editing. Never assume file content. |
| **postgres** | Before writing ANY SQL or migration: inspect live schema, check table structure, verify column types, test queries against real data. Check both tenant registries (`public.tenants` legacy, `public.customer_tenants` canonical) and `public.users` before touching identity/tenancy code. |
| **kubernetes** | Before writing ANY K8s manifest: check API versions, inspect live cluster resources, validate existing deployments, read pod logs. |
| **docker** | Before writing Dockerfiles or compose-equivalent configs: check base image tags, inspect running containers, validate build output. |
| **fetch** | Before writing library code: fetch official docs for the exact library version in use (Chi v5, FastAPI 0.111+, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Spring Boot, golang-migrate v4, OTel SDKs). Never rely on training data alone for API details. |
| **prometheus** | Before writing PromQL queries or Grafana dashboards: validate metric names and labels against live Prometheus. |

### Concrete MCP usage rules

- **PostgreSQL syntax / migrations:** Use the postgres MCP to inspect the live schema
  before writing `.up.sql` files. Verify extensions, existing tables, column types,
  and index names. Never write `CREATE TABLE` without knowing what already exists.

- **K8s manifests:** Use the kubernetes MCP to check `kubectl api-resources`,
  confirm CRD availability (e.g. Istio `VirtualService`, `RequestAuthentication`,
  OPA `AuthorizationPolicy`), and inspect current cluster state before writing YAML.
  Always verify `apiVersion` against the live cluster — never hardcode versions
  from memory.

- **Library APIs:** Use the fetch MCP to read official documentation when writing
  code that calls external libraries. Examples:
  - Chi v5 router — `https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/chi/v5`
  - FastAPI — `https://fastapi.tiangolo.com`
  - SQLAlchemy 2.x async — `https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/asyncio.html`
  - Spring Boot — `https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/`
  - golang-migrate — `https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate`
  - OTel Go SDK — `https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel`
  - OTel Python SDK — `https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io`
  - Istio APIs — `https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/`

## 3. Architecture Decisions — Must Be Respected

### No dedicated API Gateway service
Istio IngressGateway handles everything: JWT validation, tenant routing, header
injection, RBAC via OPA, rate limiting, mTLS — for **both** apps. Never suggest
or create a Go API Gateway service.

### No Docker Compose
All deployments go directly to the kubeadm K8s cluster. There is no `docker-compose.yml`
anywhere in this repo.

### PostgreSQL is one external standalone instance, shared by both apps
PostgreSQL **17.5** runs on a **separate machine outside K8s**
(`172.16.12.226:5432`, db/user/pass all `itsm`). It is NOT deployed as a K8s
StatefulSet. Never create K8s manifests for PostgreSQL (StatefulSet, PVC,
StorageClass for DB). Both `platform-app` and `customer-app` connect to the
**same instance** using `DATABASE_URL`.

### DATABASE_URL is the single connection variable
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://itsm:itsm@172.16.12.226:5432/itsm?sslmode=disable
```
All services, scripts, and migration commands use this one variable. Never
split it into DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER etc. The repo's `.env` has been known
to drift to a stale IP — verify against this file, not the checked-in `.env`,
if they disagree.

### Services NEVER re-validate the JWT
Istio validates the JWT and injects two headers for every authenticated request:
- `X-Tenant-ID` — from the `tenant_id` JWT claim (**absent, not empty, for
  platform staff** — see Identity model below; an absent header is a valid
  "no tenant" state, not an error)
- `X-User-Role` — from the `role` JWT claim

Services read these headers directly. They never parse or verify the JWT
themselves. There is no JWT library call inside service handlers (only inside
`user-service` for token issuance).

### Two-layer AuthZ model
1. **Istio AuthorizationPolicy (ALLOW/DENY)** — tenant isolation at the mesh level
2. **OPA ext_authz (CUSTOM action)** — RBAC: role + HTTP method + path rules via Rego

Both layers apply to both apps. Services themselves contain zero authorization logic.

### Identity model — one engine, one users table, for both apps
`customer-app` has **no identity engine of its own**. All login goes through
platform-app's `user-service`, against a single shared `public.users` table
(migration `000006_create_shared_users.up.sql`, per
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-identity-tenancy-consolidation-design.md`):

```sql
public.users(
  id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email         TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name     TEXT,
  role          TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN (
                    'admin','agent','viewer',
                    'platform_admin','platform_analyst'
                )),
  tenant_id     TEXT NULL,  -- NULL = platform staff; else = customer_tenants.slug
  is_active     BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

- One row population, two kinds of user: `customer-app`'s tenant-scoped end
  users (`tenant_id` = a `customer_tenants.slug`) and `platform-app`'s own
  cross-tenant staff (`tenant_id = NULL`, roles `platform_admin` /
  `platform_analyst`).
- **Login is email + password only.** No "workspace/tenant slug" field,
  anywhere, in either app's UI. Do not reintroduce one.
- `issueToken` reads `tenant_id` off the authenticated user row; if `NULL`,
  the claim is **omitted from the JWT entirely** (not set empty). Istio's
  `outputClaimToHeaders` then simply doesn't inject `X-Tenant-ID` — this
  requires **zero Istio config changes**.
- Cross-tenant data browsing by platform staff is explicitly **not** covered
  by this model yet (Istio can't inject a header from a claim that doesn't
  exist) — it needs its own mechanism, deferred to the future platform-app UI
  work. Don't invent one ad hoc.

### Business-data tenancy — schema-per-tenant, separate from identity
Two parallel schema-per-tenant setups, on the same Postgres instance, **not**
the same thing as the identity model above:

- **`platform-app`** (legacy): `tenant_a` / `tenant_b` / `tenant_c` schemas,
  registry `public.tenants`. **Retired for identity/login purposes** — nothing
  reads this for auth anymore — but its data (`assets`, `incidents`,
  `incident_events`) is left physically untouched. Where these tenants end up
  relative to `customer_a/b/c` is an **open, undecided question** — don't
  silently migrate or drop this data.
- **`customer-app`** (canonical going forward): `customer_a` / `customer_b` /
  `customer_c` schemas, registry `public.customer_tenants`, created via
  `create_customer_tenant_schema(slug)`. Tables: `restaurants` (owned by
  catalog-service), `menu_items` FK→restaurants (catalog-service), `orders`
  FK→restaurants (order-service), `deliveries` FK→orders (delivery-service),
  `payments` FK→orders (payment-service).
- `search_path` is set **per connection** at request time (not in the DSN),
  from the tenant slug resolved server-side — never from a client-supplied field.

### ENV=dev|qa everywhere
Every script, Helm chart, K8s manifest, and ArgoCD Application must accept
`ENV=dev` (default) or `ENV=qa`. Switching environments changes only this variable —
no manual YAML edits. Default is always `dev`.

---

## 4. Hardware Constraints — Enforce in All Manifests

Kubeadm cluster: 3 nodes, **4 vCPU / 3.8 GiB each → 12 vCPU / 11.4 GiB total.**
**Memory is the binding constraint, not CPU** (12 vCPU available, well under 1
requested today). Real, measured headroom is **~5 GiB free on the two
workers** — plan against that number, not a bigger one.

**HPA: min=1, max=2 replicas for all stateless services, in both apps. Never
set max=3 or higher.** CPU threshold for HPA: 70%. **Exception:** customer-app
in `dev` is currently capped at `max=1` (no scale-out at all) — a
capacity-driven, dev-only carve-out, not a change to this rule. See "Known
open capacity risk" below.

### Resource limits (use these in all Helm templates and K8s manifests)

**Platform App:**

| Service | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Mem Request | Mem Limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend | 50m | 200m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| User Service (Go) | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| Asset Service (Python) | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| Incident Service (Python) | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| Notification Service (Go) | 50m | 200m | 64Mi | 128Mi |
| AI Service (Python) | 100m | 400m | 256Mi | 512Mi |
| Redis | 50m | 200m | 64Mi | 256Mi |
| RabbitMQ | 100m | 300m | 256Mi | 512Mi |
| OTel Collector | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| Prometheus | 150m | 400m | 256Mi | 512Mi |
| Loki | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| Jaeger (all-in-one) | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| Grafana | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| ArgoCD (total) | 300m | 800m | 512Mi | 1Gi |
| Istio (pilot + sidecars) | 200m | 500m | 256Mi | 512Mi |

**Customer App** (from `customer-app/infra/helm/customer-app/values.yaml`):

| Service | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Mem Request | Mem Limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| order-service (Go) | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| catalog-service (Python) | 100m | 300m | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| delivery-service (Java) | 100m | 300m | 256Mi | 512Mi |
| payment-service (Java) | 100m | 300m | 256Mi | 512Mi |
| Frontend (Hearth — nginx:alpine) | 50m | 200m | 64Mi | 128Mi |
| Redis | 50m | 200m | 64Mi | 256Mi |
| Istio sidecars (×5) | ~100m each | — | ~128Mi each | ~128Mi each |

**Capacity risk — RESOLVED 2026-09-25 for dev (Phase 9, #36):** Java services
run 2× the memory footprint of the Go/Python ones, and by 2026-09-25 the
observability stack (Phase 7) and ArgoCD (Phase 8) had both landed, dropping
real free memory on the two worker nodes from ~5 GiB (2026-09-01) to ~3.7 GiB
— with the control-plane node itself (also schedulable) down to
~600-900 MiB free. Customer-app at HPA max (4 services × 2 replicas) plus
sidecars would need ~4 GiB at the limit ceiling, which no longer fits.
Decision: capped customer-app's `hpa.maxReplicas` at **1** in dev (no
scale-out) rather than the other two options — adding node RAM is an
infra change outside repo scope, and lowering the Java services' memory
limits back down would undo the Phase 7 OOM fix (128Mi/256Mi was proven too
tight; see `customer-app/infra/helm/customer-app/values.yaml`'s own comment
on `deliveryService`/`paymentService`). This is a dev-only, capacity-driven
exception to the HPA rule above — revisit if/when more node RAM is added or
this risk is re-evaluated for a QA/prod environment. Check
`INFRA-INVENTORY.md` for the current measured picture before sizing
anything new.

## 5. OTel Instrumentation — Required from Day One

Every service must have **both** auto-instrumentation and manual business
instrumentation. **The two apps use different span-naming and metric
namespaces — do not cross them.**

### Span naming convention

**Platform App** (including `ai-service` — see `ai-engine/CLAUDE.md` §3 for
its `itsm.ai.<track>.<operation>` extension):
```
itsm.<service>.<operation>

Examples:
  itsm.incident.create
  itsm.incident.list
  itsm.asset.search
  itsm.user.login
  itsm.notification.send
  itsm.user.internal_get
```

**Customer App** (confirmed in code — `catalog-service/app/router.py`,
`order-service/internal/handlers/orders.go`):
```
customer.<service>.<operation>

Examples:
  customer.catalog.list_restaurants
  customer.catalog.create_restaurant
  customer.catalog.create_menu_item
  customer.catalog.cache_lookup
  customer.order.create
  customer.order.list
  customer.order.get
  customer.order.update_status
```

**Known gap — RESOLVED (Phase 7):** `delivery-service` and `payment-service`
(Java) now have manual `@WithSpan` business spans with `tenant.id`/
`user.role` attributes, same as the rest of the customer-app services —
verified live end-to-end during Phase 7 and again during Phase 10's
happy-path test (2026-09-25).

**New known gap — confirmed 2026-09-25 (Phase 10):** `order-service`,
`delivery-service`, and `payment-service` have no structured business-event
logging and no custom Prometheus counters (`catalog-service` has both —
`customer_restaurants_created_total` etc.). Confirmed live: real INFO-level
log lines exist for all 3 services in Loki (correctly labeled, timed right
around a live test order), but none contain the order/delivery/payment ID
as searchable text — so log-based correlation by entity ID isn't possible
for these 3 services today, only trace-based correlation. Not blocking
(traces alone satisfy tenant-tagged observability for these services), but
a real depth gap if log/metric-based correlation is ever needed.

### Required span attributes on every business span
```python
span.set_attribute("tenant.id", tenant_id)   # from X-Tenant-ID header
span.set_attribute("user.role", role)         # from X-User-Role header
```

### Custom metrics (Prometheus via OTel SDK)
```
itsm_incidents_created_total{tenant, priority}       counter
itsm_incidents_resolved_duration_seconds{priority}   histogram
itsm_assets_active_count{tenant, asset_type}         gauge
itsm_cache_hits_total{tenant, resource}              counter
itsm_cache_misses_total{tenant, resource}            counter
```
Customer-app metrics follow the same shape under a `customer_` prefix when
they're added — keep the two namespaces as separate as the span names are.

### W3C TraceContext propagation
- HTTP: `traceparent` header — Istio Envoy propagates automatically
- RabbitMQ AMQP: store `traceparent` string in AMQP message headers

## 6. Technology Stack Quick Reference

### Languages & frameworks

**Platform App:**
| Service | Language | Framework | Key libs |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Service | Go 1.22+ | Chi v5 | `pgx/v5`, `golang-jwt/jwt v5`, `otelchi` |
| Notification Service | Go 1.22+ | Chi v5 | `pgx/v5`, amqp091-go |
| Asset Service | Python 3.12+ | FastAPI 0.111+ | SQLAlchemy 2.x async, asyncpg |
| Incident Service | Python 3.12+ | FastAPI 0.111+ | SQLAlchemy 2.x async, asyncpg, aio-pika |
| AI Service | Python 3.12+ | FastAPI 0.111+ | pgvector, LLM provider — see `ai-engine/CLAUDE.md` |
| Frontend (Synap UI) | TypeScript | Vite + React 18 | React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand, CSS Modules/OKLCH tokens |

**Customer App:**
| Service | Language | Framework | Key libs |
|---|---|---|---|
| order-service | Go 1.22+ | Chi v5 | `pgx/v5` |
| catalog-service | Python 3.12+ | FastAPI 0.111+ | SQLAlchemy 2.x async, asyncpg |
| delivery-service | Java | Spring Boot | — |
| payment-service | Java | Spring Boot | — |
| Frontend ("Hearth") | TypeScript | Vite + React 18 | React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand, CSS Modules, `lucide-react` — Aurora design system (same as platform-app's Synap UI). Login + 6-digit MFA verify (issue #45) and App Shell + Dashboard + AI Copilot (issue #54) are built, both 100% mocked for the Copilot's conversation data; Orders, Menu, Deliveries, Payments specced in `customer-app/design_handoff/design_handoff_hearth/BUILD_PLAN.md`, not yet built — each is its own future roadmap task per §11 |

### JWT (RS256 — one issuer for both apps)
Claims: `sub`, `tenant_id` (omitted, not empty, for platform staff), `role`,
`email`, `exp`, `iat`, `jti`
Issued by: `user-service` (signs with RSA-2048 private key; `kid: itsm-rs256-v1`)
Validated by: Istio `RequestAuthentication` via JWKS endpoint on `user-service`
(`/api/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`) — the **only** JWKS endpoint in the system;
`customer-app` does not have its own.

### Key infrastructure
- **Kubernetes:** kubeadm 1.29+, already installed, 3 nodes
- **Service mesh:** Istio (demo profile)
- **Policy engine:** OPA 0.65+ with Envoy plugin, port 9191 gRPC
- **Cache:** Redis 7.x (external, same machine as Postgres or separate) — one instance per app
- **Queue:** RabbitMQ 3.13.x (platform-app only, today)
- **GitOps:** ArgoCD 2.11+
- **Helm:** 3.15+
- **DB migrations:** golang-migrate-style naming (`000001_name.up.sql` /
  `.down.sql`) in `platform-app`; `customer-app` uses its own
  `customer-app/scripts/run-migrations.sh` with a
  `customer_app_schema_migrations` tracking table — same naming convention,
  separate runner

---

## 7. Code Quality Rules

- **Python:** PEP8, `ruff` for linting, `black` for formatting
- **Go:** `gofmt`, `golangci-lint`
- **TypeScript:** ESLint + Prettier
- **Java:** no linter/formatter convention chosen yet — ask the user before
  picking one rather than assuming
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `infra:`
- **No new dependencies** without asking the user first
- **No Docker Compose** — not in this project at all

---

## 8. Cache Key Conventions

Two separate prefixes, one per app — do not mix them.

**Platform App:**
```
itsm:{tenant_slug}:{resource}:{operation}:{hash}

Examples:
  itsm:tenant_a:incidents:list:abc123
  itsm:tenant_a:users:u1000001
  itsm:tenant_b:assets:list:def456
```

**Customer App** (confirmed in `catalog-service/app/cache.py`):
```
customer:{tenant_slug}:{resource}:{operation}:{hash}
customer:{tenant_slug}:{resource}:*        (wildcard invalidation form)
```

Never use unprefixed keys. Never `FLUSHDB` (affects all tenants, in either app).

expected output, verification queries/commands, rollback instructions,
troubleshooting, and an acceptance checklist.

## 10. UI Development — Claude Design, Both Apps

Both `platform-app` and `customer-app` UI work is **drafted with the Claude
Design canvas feature** (the `design` skill — multi-artboard mockups
published as an Artifact) before or while writing the real implementation.
Do not hand-design UI from scratch in code first.

**Platform App:** `platform-app/design_handoff_synap/reference/` remains the
pixel-perfect source of truth for what's already speced there (its own
`CLAUDE.md` governs the details — stack, styling, mock-data rules). New
screens not yet in that prototype get drafted in Claude Design first, then
built to match. Do not port `synap-tweaks.jsx` / `tweaks-panel.jsx` — those
are prototype-only demo theming; real theme settings belong in a proper
Settings/Admin screen.

**Customer App:** "Hearth" — see `customer-app/design_handoff/CLAUDE.md` for
the full design source of truth (screen inventory, tokens, build order).
Stack: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript, same Aurora design system as platform-app
(sibling product, not a distinct brand — decision on record 2026-09-17).
Login + 6-digit MFA verify are built; the rest of the screens follow the
reference prototype's `BUILD_PLAN.md`, one roadmap task at a time, same
Claude-Design-first discipline as platform-app.

**One screen/feature at a time.** Build exactly what the current roadmap
task specifies, verify it in a browser against the design draft, then stop —
don't implement future screens speculatively.

---

## 11. Roadmap & Status — GitHub Projects Is the Source of Truth

Task-by-task status (what's done, what's next, per-service progress) lives in
the **GitHub Project**, not in this file and not in a markdown status tracker.
Do not add a phase/sprint status table back into this file or into any
other doc — it will drift out of sync the way the old ones did.

- **One roadmap task at a time.** Complete a task's stated acceptance
  criteria, verify it, then stop — don't start the next board item until the
  user confirms and the board reflects it.
- Design rationale for *why* a piece of architecture looks the way it does
  stays in `docs/superpowers/specs/`; the board tracks *what's left to build*,
  not *why it was designed this way*.

Carry these until each is explicitly closed out — don't rediscover them from
scratch in a future session, and don't assume they're fixed just because
they're not mentioned elsewhere.

- **HIGH — unauthenticated tenant param in `user-service`.**
  `InternalGetByID` (`platform-app/services/user-service/internal/handlers/users.go`)
  trusts a caller-supplied `tenant_slug` query param with no auth check beyond
  mTLS (which proves service identity, not which tenant's data the caller may
  request). Fix is designed (SPIFFE peer-principal allowlist via Istio
  `AuthorizationPolicy`) in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-identity-tenancy-consolidation-design.md`
  — not yet implemented.
- **Capacity risk — resolved for dev, open for QA/prod.** See §4's capacity
  risk note: customer-app dev is capped at HPA max=1 as of 2026-09-25; the
  underlying headroom constraint isn't fixed, just worked around, and needs
  its own decision before any future QA/prod environment is sized.
- **`argocd-repo-server` instability — root-caused and fixed 2026-09-25.**
  Two separate causes, confirmed via live evidence, NOT memory pressure:
  (1) the pod that appeared stuck in `ContainerStatusUnknown` was a
  stale, already-terminated leftover from a `k8s-worker-2` disk-pressure
  eviction (`DiskPressure` condition has since cleared; the ReplicaSet
  already self-healed by rescheduling its one desired replica onto
  `kubernetes-master`) — harmless, safe to `kubectl delete` as cleanup.
  (2) The actively-restarting replica (15 restarts/7h) was hitting the
  chart's default 1-second probe timeout on `kubernetes-master` (the
  cluster's most contended node) — confirmed NOT an OOM (33Mi/256Mi
  memory used, exit 143/SIGTERM not 137/OOMKilled). Fixed in
  `platform-app/infra/argocd/install/values.yaml`
  (`repoServer.readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds` /
  `livenessProbe.timeoutSeconds` 1→5) — same pattern as the
  delivery/payment-service probe fix. Applied via a manual
  `platform-app/scripts/install-argocd.sh` re-run on `kubernetes-master`
  (ArgoCD does not manage its own install via GitOps). **Confirmed live:**
  new pod running 0 restarts post-rollout, no further probe-timeout
  events.
- **`user-service` instability — root-caused and fixed 2026-10-09.** Same
  class of bug as the `argocd-repo-server` entry above, found while trying
  to verify the live MFA login flow for issue #54 (Dashboard + Copilot
  screen): `userService.readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` had no
  `timeoutSeconds` set, so Kubernetes defaulted to 1s. Pod was on
  `kubernetes-master` (the cluster's most contended node) and crash-looping
  — 510+ restarts, cycling every 1-5 min, exit code 0 (graceful SIGTERM from
  a failed probe, not OOM). Confirmed via events: `context deadline
  exceeded` on both probes while the container itself was idle (1m CPU /
  7Mi mem, both far under limits) — the app was never actually unhealthy.
  **This is the third service hitting this exact chart-default-timeout bug**
  (after argocd-repo-server and delivery/payment-service) — worth checking
  any *other* service's probes for a missing `timeoutSeconds` before it
  surfaces again. Fixed in `platform-app/infra/helm/itsm-app/values.yaml`
  (`userService.readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds` / `livenessProbe.timeoutSeconds`
  added, 1→5) plus the corresponding template fields in
  `templates/user-service/deployment.yaml` (previously didn't reference
  `timeoutSeconds` at all). Applied via `helm upgrade --install itsm-app`
  on `kubernetes-master`. **Confirmed live:** new pod (new ReplicaSet),
  2 restarts in the first 88 min (vs. one every 1-5 min before), zero
  `Unhealthy`/`BackOff` events since rollout.
- **Telemetry depth gap** — see §5's "New known gap" (no structured
  business-event logs or custom metrics on order/delivery/payment-service;
  trace-only correlation for those 3 services).
- **Cross-tenant data browsing by platform staff** — no mechanism designed
  yet; see §3's Identity model note. Don't build an ad hoc workaround.
- **Undecided:** where platform-app's legacy `tenant_a/b/c` data (`assets`,
  `incidents`) ends up relative to `customer_a/b/c` — see §3's Business-data
  tenancy note.

## 13. What Not to Do

- Do NOT run `git commit` or `git push` (to any branch, including feature
  branches) against this repo's GitHub remote, under any circumstances — not
  even if asked explicitly mid-session. Make edits locally and leave them
  uncommitted; the repo owner reviews the diff in their own IDE and commits/
  pushes it themselves. This includes not opening PRs on their behalf.
- Do NOT create a dedicated API Gateway service
- Do NOT create K8s StatefulSet or PVC for PostgreSQL
- Do NOT create `docker-compose.yml`
- Do NOT set HPA max replicas > 2, in either app
- Do NOT validate JWT inside application service handlers
- Do NOT set `search_path` in the DSN — set it per connection at request time
- Do NOT split `DATABASE_URL` into separate host/port/user/pass variables
- Do NOT add a "workspace/tenant slug" field back into login — it's email +
  password only, tenant is resolved server-side from the `public.users` row
- Do NOT give `customer-app` its own identity engine or JWKS endpoint —
  `user-service` is the only one
- Do NOT add dependencies not in the tech stack without asking
- Do NOT invent a Java lint/format convention — ask the user first
- Do NOT start the next roadmap task before the current one's acceptance
  criteria are met and the board is updated
- Do NOT write K8s `apiVersion` values from memory — check with kubernetes MCP first
- Do NOT write SQL against assumed schema — check with postgres MCP first
- Do NOT delete or rewrite any tracked file as "cleanup" without first
  listing the exact files/dirs and getting the user's explicit approval
